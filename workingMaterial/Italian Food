So comedians have been throwing opinions out there and getting canceled for it, I've got an opinion but I'm not sure how it's going to come off. 

Italian food fucking sucks. 

Not Italians, even though they gave us such hits as Mousilini, Vespas, and Catholocism.

American Italian food sucks.

Not just Olive Garden and Sabaros, those are well established they suck; great price but they suck. 

I'm talking all American Italian food. 

I'm tired of being gaslit by the cast of the jersey shore (Dating myself here), if you correct my pronounciation on Mozerella or Mozerel or Ricotta to Ricot 
your grandma's food sucked and yours does too. 

This is a highly personal thing I know … and it's okay … your food sucks. Just stop pretending.

Take a hamburger—don't have the decency to put it on a bun, but dry that bread out and throw it into a glob of meat—and then added the scantest amount of droed Parsley

FUCKING PARSELY 

it's a damn garnish on a good day when it's fresh, you're gonna dry that out and call it flavor? 

at least the swedish have a good sauce and make them manageable

then put that shit on pasta. 

PASTA, don't get me started

"Penne is better for holding sauce" "Spaghetti is better" … it's the same dough.

Noodles are noodles and none of it helps your bland ass sauce, Karen. Excuse me … Kourtney.

I'm from the midwest, we don't wait till dessert and then have a 30 minute argument about which shape of Christmas Cookie holds the milk better. 

We could! It's the Tree shaped one. The house shape barely fits in the damn glass.

But we don't.

I don't care which shape holds the sauce better, the sauce tastes like canned tomatoes no matter what you do. 

Ragu, your grandma's stuff, it's all the same stuff. It's the whitest shit ever, and you have a gallon pot on the stove, cause yeah you're making tomato sauce for all of Seaside Heights.

Then you add a clove of garlic, snicker, look around to see who's watching like you're doing something bad and add one more. 

ONLY ONE MORE FUCKING CLOVE.

Not a head of garlic per GALLON JUG of tomatoes two cloves. You're gonna taste the essence of garlic that drove by and said Nah lets go get in something better than shitty gaspatcho. 

Hotspatcho.

Then it's a fucking reenactment of Princess and the Pea. 

Add like the smallest amount of salt, like Micro grains, to the ocean of tomatoes.

Then some lazy ass uncle takes a break from telling you that spaghett (cause ending a word is a lot) is the only true noodle is going to warn them to not oversalt the food. 

NOT A DAMN CHANCE OF THAT SHIT HAPPENING GUIDO.

[Needs another piece about salt here]

Then let it "simmer", that's not cooking cooking it's … warming … with pretensions.

Let it simmer on the stove, no bubbling just staying luke warm watching the meatballs dry out even further, for HOURS, what spices are getting to know each other?

Those cloves of garlic aren't going to find each other in Kevin Kostner's water world of tomato juice. That sprig of basil? cause we didn't want it spicy, a seccond spring is just insanity, That sprig of basil will end up on the side of a milk carton it's before someone finds it.

Or the spent piece of permesian cheese… yeah they threw in the rind of a permesean cheese like this is gonna help, at best it might thicken it but they'll never get it thicker than Uncle Guido's flop sweat.

So they ladel this shitty ass sauce on my italian christmas cookie plate of pasta and the only thing soaking up this hotspatcho is a dried out testicle of meat.

I get you grew up with this culinary hate crime, but nostalgia isn't a cuisine. Italian food sucks.
