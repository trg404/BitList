So comedians have been throwing opinions out there and getting canceled for it, I've got an opinion I want to share but I'm not sure how it's going to come off. 
So I'm going to be as gentle and specific with this topic as I can be. 
Italian food fucking sucks. 


I'm not saying all Italians, Even though they gave us such hits as Mousilini, Vespas, and Catholocism. I'm actually being specific. 

American Italian food sucks.
Not just like Olive Garden and Sabaros, Those are well established they suck, great for the price but they suck. I'm talking all American Italian food. 
If you relate to the cast of the jersey shore (Dating myself here) 
Or if you have to explain to me how authentic this is cause it came from some street with a number for a name
If you correct my pronounciation on Mozerella or Mozerel or Ricotta to Ricot 
your grandma's food sucked and yours does too. 

I'm tired of being gaslighted by the northeast into pretending this is good food.
